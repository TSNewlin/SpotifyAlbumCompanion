# Album Companion For Spotify

<h3>Overview</h3>
This Album Companion for Spotify is a tool that provides information and recommendations based on an album that the user
provides. Users are able to type the name of an album into the search bar and if that album exists on the Spotify 
platform the album companion will provide information based on metadata provided by the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/). 
Using Spotify's API users are able to get ten album recommendations based on the album they searched for through the 
album companion.
